## There are 5 general phases of a network intrusion.  There is some overlap between these steps, but they provide a general idea of how a hacker approaches an exploitation

# 1) Reconnaissance
This step is general passive in the sense that the attacker doesn't communicate anything to their target computer systems.  This step involves mostly google searches and public records about the target.  
This can be anything from a DNS record to any information that is available using google.  

https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database/
http://www.google-dorking.com/
- The google hacking DB contains a list of google searches, called dorks, that can be used to reveal web servers that are misconfigured and provide information they shouldn't.

https://d4msec.wordpress.com/2015/09/03/google-dorks-for-finding-emails-admin-users-etc/
- Google provides a wealth of knowledge.  You can use the advanced search operators to gain a wide variety of information about a target.  

https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/hackers/fundamentals-computer-hacking-956
- SANS has an excellent article about some tools that are available to gather WHOIS and DNS records of websites to accomplish during the Reconnaissance phase.  This article refers to the "footprinting" phase, which is just another term for Reconnaissance.  Some of the scanning techniques covered are active, rather than passive, so I think about them as part of the scanning phase.


# 2) Scanning
Scanning is the use of automated or manual methods to gain more information about specific target systems.  This is an active step.  Scanning involves interacting with the target to gain information about them.  This is where things begin to become illegal if you do not have consent from the owner(s) of the system you are targeting.  Only do these techniques against systems you are authorized to be using them against.

https://nmap.org/
https://www.linux.com/learn/who-and-what-my-network-probing-your-network-linux
- NMAP is an incredibly powerful port scanning tool.  NMAP generates various types of network traffic to fingerprint a particular system and determine various types of information about it.  This can vary from a simple ping scan to a specified range of ports to a large number of types of network traffic that can tell you the type of OS the end point is running and what type of software is running on it.  A competent hacker will limit these scans to reduce the likelihood of their scans being detected. This activity is considered illegal in some jurisdictions, use it with caution.

http://etherealmind.com/tech-notes-ping-sweep-ip-subnet/
- I would encourage anyone reading this to try their hand at bash scripting for some of the simpler functions of NMAP such as ping sweeps or things of that nature.  The above is a great resource for basic bash scripting operations and an example of a ping sweeping script in bash.

# 3) Gaining Access
This step involves using a variety of techniques to gain access to a target system.  This usually involves some combination of exploits and social engineering and makes use of the information gained in the previous two steps.  

- There is some terminology that needs to be understood in regards to exploits.
- An exploit is a way of using code to make something happen on a server typically using a vulnerability.
- A vulnerability is some sort of insecurity in the software that can be leveraged by an exploit.  
- There can be more than one exploit created for a particular vulnerability and vulnerabilities can either be publicly known or unknown to the public.
- A vulnerability that is unknown to the public is known as a zero day vulnerability.  

https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=windows
- One of the most well known vulnerability reporting mechanisms is the Common Vulnerability and Exposures list put out by Mitre.  The above is an example of all of the CVEs that contain 'Windows'.

https://www.exploit-db.com/
- Exploit DB contains a large database of exploits and is searchable by software version, CVE, or keyword.
These exploits contain the source code for the exploit.  Compile at your own risk and remember to never run source code that you do not understand.

https://www.metasploit.com/
https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/
- Metasploit is a framework of exploits and exploit delivery mechanisms.  This is a very powerful tool that can be used to run exploits against a target system.  

https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Fuzzing
- To more fully understand what is going on with these exploit attempts, you can learn a bit about how exploits are discovered and written.  There are a wide variety of ways of discovering new exploits in a process known as "fuzzing"

http://www.primalsecurity.net/0x0-exploit-tutorial-buffer-overflow-vanilla-eip-overwrite-2/
- A common type of exploit type is a buffer overflow.  This takes advantage of lower level programming languages that allow the memory buffer of a program to be overwritten and arbitrary code to be run against a target system.  There are many tutorials available about buffer overflows and how to write them.  The above example is a complete tutorial about how to identify and write a new exploit regarding a buffer overflow.

- There are many more types of attacks that I haven't covered here.

# 4) Maintaining Access
This is the step that occurs after an attacker has penetrated the taget system.  This often involves rootkits or other mechanisms of maintaining access to a target system.

https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/writing-windows-10-rootkit-part-1-0165781/
- This article describes a high level overview of how a rootkit could work against Windows 10.

# 5) Covering Tracks.
This step requires knowledge of how a computer system and network devices log the activity of an attacker.

https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/hack-like-pro-cover-your-tracks-leave-no-trace-behind-target-system-0148123/
- This blog post covers it fairly well.  The basic idea is to remove any evidence that a system was compromised.

http://tools.kali.org/tools-listing
- Many of the above steps have a dedicated folder within Kali linux that contains a huge amount of tools to cover each of the specific phases of an attack.  The URL above has a listing with descriptions of the various tools in Kali.



# Miscellaneous Hacking Techniques and tools

# Wireless Exploitation
- There are a lot of tools available for wireless exploitation.  This exploitation can range from bluetooth to wifi network exploitation.

https://www.aircrack-ng.org/
- aircrack-ng is a popular suite of tools for exploiting wifi.

https://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup/WLAN#Promiscuous_mode
- Wireshark can be used to collect packets passively.  

These techniques require a wifi NIC capable of packet injection such as the one below:
https://www.amazon.com/Network-Wireless-802-11g-Adapter-AWUS036H/dp/B000WXSO76
- Some laptop wifi NICs are capable of packet injection.  You can test this out through aircrack.

BeEF - Browser Exploitation Framework
- BeEF allows an attack to conduct client-side exploits.  This can leverage social engineering to exploit a target's web browser.

SQL Injection
- This is an attack that allows an attacker to view or modify data on a SQL server.
https://information.rapid7.com/rs/rapid7/images/R7%20SQL_Injection_Cheat_Sheet.v1.pdf

MITM - Man in the middle attack
- This attack allows you to intercept network traffic using a variety of network spoofing techniques.  This attack requires knowledge of ARP and basic network routing.

Setting up your environment
There are several ways to set up your environment.  The basic idea is to download a vulnerable ISO, set it up as a virtual machine or dedicated host, and then test exploits against it.

You can find resources below for vulnerable ISOs:
- Lots of vulnerable ISOs

- General test environment guidance
