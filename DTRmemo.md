# DTR: Define the Relationship

Use this template to when conducting DTR with your project partners. It's recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation.

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

 What are your learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
- Become more comfortable with git. How do you traverse a trie.  How is that compared to a binary search tree?

 What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
- Pair to make sure we both understand the concept and approach and divide into bite size chunks.  Have a mutual sign-off of understanding what we are doing.  Navigator driver with comfortable pauses to process and review.


 How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
- Direct feedback and let eachother know if the other person isnt being direct enough or is being too direct.
- If we disagree on a minor stylistic thing, rock-paper-scissors and move on
- Becki prefers nudging vs explaining. I prefer a more explaination style.

 How would you describe your work style?
- Prefer to have a plan before jumping into building the code out.
- If we are stuck ask for help or find help online, do research.

 What are your strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
- Tactical vs strategic thinking.  We can make the other person see more of the bigger picture or help the person seeing the big picture focus on the small picture.  We both value the idea of owning a task to completion.

 Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
- Don't be afraid to scrap the entire project.  Don't panic if it doesn't come together.  Make use of git.

 How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
- Becki can suggest a meeting time and I have veto power.
- Face to face after class with a screenhero to review in the evening.

 How will we overcome obstacles?
- Honesty and not taking things personally
- Address issues immediately

 What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
- Coffeeshops in the denver downtown area or school
- Prefer quiet environment when actually coding.
- Breweries are cool to meet

 What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
- Becki takes public transit, so remote sessions at night work best for her.  I ride my bike and can access most places downtown relatively quickly.

 What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
- Direct and immediate feedback.

 What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
- learn git together
- verbal description of program flow

 What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
- git.  screenhero.  slack.  trello.

 How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
- ask for help when we need it

 How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
- Have clear objective criteria on success and agree on successful
- Write comments for the other person's code after they explain it

 How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?
- beer

### Template for DTR Memo

Project:

Group Member Names: Brandon Stewart & Becki Srofe

Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project?
- A better understanding tries and how they relate to Binary Search Trees
- A better understanding of git and how it can help us
- How to pair effectively

Goals and expectations:
- Learn how a trie works. We hope to complete the project, but that is not the end goal.

Team strengths:
- We can use trello to bridge the gap between Becki's organized list mentality and Brandon's lack of organized thoughts.
- We both are good at discussing conceptual things and relaying them to one another
- We both appreciate blunt, honest, and immediate feedback and do our best to not take the feedback personally.
- We both like craft beer.

How to overcome obstacles:
- For minor, stylistic things, do rock paper scissors instead of having a long debate
- For major decisions we can arrive at a decision after a discussion about the pros and cons of both ideas.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?):
- Becki lives in Parker and cannot get to the city very quickly.
- Brandon does not have a car.
- We both like craft beer so we may meet at a brewery to pair.
- Neither of us are morning people, but we are willing to meet before class if necessary.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):
- We will use Slack asyncronously.  We don't expect an immediate response to Slack messages.
- We will use Screenhero at night to review what we did during the day and have a meeting after class to discuss our agenda for the day.

Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
- Becki would like to become better at general computer usage (Hotkeys, atom packages, git etc.)
- Brandon would like to become better at communicating complex workflows involving multiple methods.
- Strength: We both feel like we are good at explaining and teaching things we understand to others.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
TBD.  We need to plan the specific aspects.  Brandon errs on the strategic side of things, while Becki can focus on the more tactical (Short-term) goals.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):
-After class or at first work period we will do code review and have commented code finished and discuss commented code and next steps. We will screenhero around 9:30 to review branches and merge to master. We will make comments on other partners code before arriving at class the next day.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
Frank, open, and immediate.

Ideas:
-Start with dumb nodes(believe it takes less memory) and delete everything if it doesn't work
-ARGV uses different memory than the ruby program
-Will need to use a recursive loop with a break condition on the string inputted
-As you input letters it will move down the tree
-An alternative implementation represents a node as a triple (symbol, child, next) and links the children of a node together as a singly linked list: child points to the node's first child, next to the parent node's next child.
-Node will need a weight variable and a symbol, child, next variable

Tools:
Slack, trello, git, github.  Git time machine.
